#### Get it!

If you haven't done so already, get a fresh copy of Phundament 3:

A) git clone

$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/schmunk42/phundament.git phundament


B) github download

Goto https://github.com/schmunk42/phundament


For running Phunament 3 you need to setup an standard Yii 
Web-Application skeleton.
As Yii is currently not bundled with Phundament 3 you have to use an 
exisiting Yii Framework installation to perform this task.
